- Add file-saving/loading feature so tasks persist after program exits  
- Add task deadlines and priority levels  
- Create a GUI version using Qt or SFML  

## 📝 Note  
- This is a basic version intended for beginners learning C++.  
- The task list is not persistent — it will reset each time the program restarts.
